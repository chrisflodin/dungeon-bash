# Concept

The game consists of a player stepping through some number of levels. On each level the player encounters some number of enemies and those enemies all or whoever has the greatest power wins that level.
If the player loses, he also loses one health.
The player continues until he reached the end or until he is defeated meaning he has run out of health.
