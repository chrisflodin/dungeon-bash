## Dungeon Bash

This is a project to create a roguelike in the terminal.

### How to get set up

- Install node
- Pull the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`

### Concept

The game consists of a player stepping through some number of levels. On each level the player encounters some number of enemies.

### Battle

- A battle is played in turns.
- Each turn, the following happens:
  - The unit with the highest initiative starts.
  - The unit can attack
- Turns continue until all enemies are killed or the player is.

Have fun!
